[![NPM](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/react-useonview.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-useonview) [![JavaScript Style Guide](https://img.shields.io/badge/code_style-standard-brightgreen.svg)](https://standardjs.com)

A react hook to trigger afunction when an component is scrolled into view. The given function will also be triggered on every subsequent scroll. So maybe add a closure to prevent this.

## Install

```bash
npm install --save react-useonview
```

or

```bash
yarn add react-useonview
```

## Usage

```jsx
import React, { Component } from 'react';

import useOnView from 'react-useonview';

const App = () => {
  const [visible, setVisible] = useState(false);

  const trigger = useOnView(() => setVisible(true));

  return (
    <div>
      <div style={{ height: '100vh' }}></div>
      <div
        ref={trigger}
        style={{ opacity: visible ? '1' : '0', transition: '1s' }}
      >
        I appear when scrolled into view
      </div>
    </div>
  );
};
```

## notes

- the function will probably execute several times

- does not care whether the element which has the ref attached is actually visible

- also executes when scrolled past element
